Virtual AI Doctor – Enterprise-Grade Intelligent Medical Platform

You are a senior AI systems architect, ML engineer, backend security specialist, and advanced frontend engineer.

Your task is to design and generate a fully functional, production-grade Virtual AI Doctor Web Platform.

This is NOT a demo.
This is NOT a mock.
This is NOT a prototype.
This must function using real scraped medical data and real ML pipelines.

All components must be logically connected and operational.

TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3 (Advanced animations, gradients, glassmorphism)

Vanilla JavaScript only

Backend:

Python (Flask preferred)

SQLite (structured relational DB)

Machine Learning:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Clustering (K-Means or Hierarchical)

Scikit-learn allowed (lightweight usage only)

Web Scraping:

Requests

BeautifulSoup

Real, structured data extraction

Python Advanced Concepts:

Decorators (authentication, validation, logging, rate limiting, caching)

Context managers if needed

Modular functions inside single backend file

Do NOT create bulky file structure.
Limit to maximum 4 files.

Recommended structure:

app.py

index.html

styles.css

script.js

No additional files unless absolutely required.

SYSTEM OBJECTIVE

Create an AI-driven virtual medical analysis platform that:

Accepts:

Symptoms

Age

Gender

Pre-existing conditions

Vital metrics

Consultation type

Scrapes real-time medical data from trusted health websites.

Cleans and structures scraped data into:

Disease name

Associated symptoms

Severity markers

Recommended actions

Risk indicators

Trains and applies ML models dynamically:

Logistic Regression → Disease probability classification

Linear Regression → Severity score prediction

Clustering → Symptom pattern grouping

Produces:

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

Probability Score

Severity Index

Cluster Identification

Confidence Score

Emergency Flag if detected

All outputs must be algorithmically derived.
No static predefined responses.

ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

Implement a layered architecture inside limited file count:

Layer 1: Request Validation Layer

Input sanitization decorator

Schema validation

Layer 2: Authentication Layer

Password hashing

Session management

Auth decorator

Layer 3: Scraping Layer

Real-time scraping

Structured parsing

HTML cleaning

Data normalization

Layer 4: Feature Engineering Layer

Convert symptoms to feature vectors

Encode categorical inputs

Normalize numeric inputs

Layer 5: ML Training + Inference Layer

Train on scraped + historical stored data

Persist model in memory

Retrain periodically if new data collected

Layer 6: Decision Fusion Engine
Combine:

Logistic probability

Regression severity score

Cluster proximity score

Generate final structured medical advisory.

Layer 7: Logging & Monitoring

Decorator-based request logging

Performance timing

Error tracking

FRONTEND DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

UI must resemble a modern AI medical chat system.

Design Requirements:

Animated gradient background

Glassmorphism UI cards

Instagram-style chat theme switching

Chat bubbles (user vs system)

Typing animation

Animated message rendering

Smooth transitions

Floating action buttons

Dark/light mode toggle

Fully responsive

No Bootstrap

No heavy UI frameworks

Pure CSS animations only

Must look like:
Premium health-tech SaaS dashboard.

FUNCTIONAL MODULES

User Authentication System

Consultation Chat Interface

Symptom Input Panel

Real-time Scraping Engine

ML Prediction Engine

Cluster Visualization (text-based is acceptable)

Risk Meter Indicator

Confidence Score Display

Consultation History Storage

Output probability score

Linear Regression:

Severity index prediction

Progression trend scoring

Clustering:

Identify patient symptom similarity groups

Assign cluster ID
